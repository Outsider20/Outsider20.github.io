Game Initialization:

#newGame button creates a new game by sending a POST request to the server
#newGameBoard allows creating a game with a custom board configuration
enableInputs() function enables game interaction buttons


Board Interaction:

refreshBoard() fetches the current game state and updates the board display
#refresh button manually refreshes the board
Each piece is represented by a string containing color, kind, value, and position


Move Mechanics:

#move button allows manual move input by specifying 'from' and 'to' positions
#play button likely triggers an AI or automated move
updateLastMove() updates the last move and captured pieces information


Error Handling:

Uses simple alert for network communication errors



The code uses jQuery for AJAX calls and assumes a backend API with endpoints for:

Creating games (/api/games)
Retrieving game state (/api/game/{id})
Making moves (/api/game/{id})

The piece representation seems to follow a format like:

Color (first character): 'W' or 'B'
Kind (second character): Piece type
Value (numeric)
Position (e.g., chess algebraic notation)

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the code or explain its functionality in more detail?
